### **1.	Introduction**

Welcome to Kramer Electronics. Kramer Electronics has been providing a world of unique, creative, and affordable solutions to a vast range of 
problems that are faced by video, audio, presentation, and broadcasting professionals daily, making the best even better.
Congratulations on purchasing your Kramer 616T Dual-Link Detachable Optical DVI Transmitter, which is ideal for the following typical applications:

- [x] Digital flat panel and plasma displays used in medical, commercial, and travel applications
- [x] Conference rooms and auditoriums
- [x] Kiosks with digital flat panel displays for presenting information
- [x] LED signboards in streets and stadiums

### **2.	Getting Started**

We recommend that you:
- [x] Unpack the equipment carefully and save the original box and packaging materials for possible future shipment
- [x] Review the contents of this user manual
- [x] Use Kramer high-performance, high-resolution cables

### **2.1.	Achieving the Best Performance**

To achieve the best performance:
- [x] Use only good-quality connection cables to avoid interference, deterioration in signal quality due to poor matching, and elevated noise levels (often associated with low-quality cables)
- [x] Do not secure the cables in tight bundles or roll the slack into tight coils
- [x] Position your Kramer 616T away from moisture, excessive sunlight, and dust


###### **Caution:** No operator serviceable parts inside the unit
###### **Warning:** Use only the Kramer Electronics input power wall adapter that is provided with the unit
###### **Warning:** Disconnect the power and unplug the unit from the wall before installing

### **3.	Overview**

The 616T and 616R are a small and lightweight fiber optic transmitter and receiver pair that transmit uncompressed resolutions up to WQXGA (2560x1600 @60Hz) or WQUXGA (3840x2400 @33Hz vertical refresh rate) over dual-link DVI to a range of dual-link meters (1640 feet) over duplex multimode fiber optic cable with two LC connectors. The 616T converts dual-link DVI signals to optical signals that it transmits to the 616R. The 616R decodes the optical signals back to a dual-link DVI signal.

The **616T** and **616R** feature:

- [x] A maximum data rate of 13.5Gbps (2.25Gbps per graphic channel)
- [x] Supported resolutions â€“ HDTV: 480p, 720p, 1080p; Versa: VGA to WQUXGA @33Hz (XGA not supported)
- [x] A range of up to 500m (1640ft) (multimode)
- [x] Duplex multimode fiber optic cable with two LC connectors (Kramer C-2LC/2LC series)
- [x] EDID capture that copies and stores the EDID from a display device (616T)
- [x] Standards compliance - supports DVI1.0, fully implemented by fiber-optic communication and DDC2B by virtual DDC
- [x] Compliance with the limits for a Class A digital device, under part 15 and 2 of FCC and CE
- [x] No EMI/RFI from the interconnecting cable
- [x] HDTV compatibility, no HDCP compliance
- [x] Two external 5V DC power adapters (supplied)
- [x] Nano tools size


### **3.1.	Powering the 616T and the 616R**

Your 616T/616R pair comes with two 5V DC power adapters. The 616R module must always be powered by the power adapter. The 616T can be powered either by an external power adapter or internally from the 5V pin on the DVI card of the computer. The 616T automatically detects if it is being powered via the external power adapter, and if so, the internal power supply is cut off. An external power adapter for the 616T is strongly recommended for better performance.

### **4.	Using the Dual-Link Detachable Optical DVI System**

This section describes how to:

- [x] Capture the EDID of the display device (see Section 4.1)
- [x] Connect the detachable optical DVI transmitter and receiver (see Section 4.2)
- [x] Avoid pitfalls when using the 616T and 616R (see Section 4.3)

### **4.1.	Capturing the EDID**

The 616T and 616R are connected via one dual-link channel. The EDID of the display device is captured by the transmitter for the computer to read.
The factory default EDID is set to WQXGA (2560x1600). If your display has this resolution, you do not need to capture the EDID

You can capture the EDID of the display device on the 616T so that when the computer connects to the 616T, it reads the virtual EDID information and identifies the device. This procedure is performed only once for the connected display device. After storing the EDID, the system can be connected and disconnected without having to set the EDID again. If the display device is replaced, the new EDID must be set on the 616T transmitter.
